# Contributing to hudi-rs

Welcome to the Apache Hudi community! We appreciate your interest in contributing to this open-source data lake
platform. This guide will walk you through the process of making your first contribution.

## File an issue

Testing and reporting bugs are also valueable contributions. Please follow
the [issue template](https://github.com/apache/hudi-rs/issues/new?template=bug_report.md) to file bug reports.

## Prepare for development

- Install Rust, e.g. as described [here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html)
- Have a compatible Python version installed (check `python/pyproject.toml` for current requirement)

## Commonly used dev commands

For most of the time, use dev commands specified in `python/Makefile`, it applies to both Python and Rust modules. You
don't need to
CD to the root directory and run `cargo` commands.

To setup python virtual env, run

```shell
make setup-env
```

Once activate virtual env, build the project for development by

```shell
make develop
```

This will install `hudi` dependency built from your local repo to the virtual env.

## Run tests locally

For Rust,

```shell
# for all tests
make test-rust
# or
cargo test --workspace

# for all tests in a crate / package
cargo test -p hudi-core

# for a specific test case
cargo test -p hudi-core table::tests::hudi_table_get_schema
```

For Python,

```shell
# for all tests
make test-python
# or
pytest -s

# for a specific test case
pytest tests/test_table_read.py -s -k "test_sample_table"
```

## Before creating a pull request

Run check command and follow the suggestions to fix the code.

```shell
make check-rust
```

## Create a pull request

### Title

The pull request title must follow the format outlined in
the [conventional commits spec](https://www.conventionalcommits.org). [Conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org)
is a standardized format for commit messages, and also allows us to auto-generate change logs and release notes. Since
only the `main` branch requires this format, and we always squash commits and then merge the PR, incremental commits'
messages
do not need to conform to it.

### Code coverage

We use [codecov](https://app.codecov.io/github/apache/hudi-rs) to generate code coverage report and enforce net positive
coverage change for PRs, with a 5% lenacy.

## Code of Conduct

We expect all community members to follow
our [Code of Conduct](https://www.apache.org/foundation/policies/conduct.html).
