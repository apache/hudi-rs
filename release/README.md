## GitHub work

> ![NOTE]
> We adhere to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/), and create a release branch for each major or minor release.

### Bump version in main branch

Execute the below script that creates a branch with the new version changes committed. Submit a PR using that.

```shell
./release/bump_version_in_main.sh
```

### Bump version in release branch

For a major or minor release, create a release branch in the format of `release/[0-9]+.[0-9]+.x` matching the target
release version. For example, if it's `0.2.0`, cut a branch named `release/0.2.x`, if it's `1.0.0`, cut a branch
named `release/1.0.x`.

For a patch release, don't cut a new branch, use its base release branch. For example, if it's `0.3.1`, cherry-pick
fixes to `release/0.3.x`.

Create and merge a PR to bump the major or minor version on the `main` branch. For example, if the current version
is `0.3.0`, bump it to `0.4.0` or `1.0.0`.

On the release branch, bump the version to indicate pre-release by pushing a commit.

- If it is meant for internal testing, go with `alpha.1`, `alpha.2`, etc
- If it is meant for public testing, go with `beta.1`, `beta.2`, etc
- If it is ready for voting, go with `rc.1`, `rc.2`, etc

```shell
cargo set-version 0.2.0-rc.1 --manifest-path crates/hudi/Cargo.toml
```

### Testing

Once the "bump version" commit is pushed, CI will be triggered and all tests need to pass before proceed to the next.

### Push tag

> ![IMPORTANT]
> The version in the code should be the target release version.

Push a tag to the commit that matches to the version in the form of `release-*`. For example,

- If the release is `0.1.0-rc.1`, the tag should `release-0.1.0-rc.1`
- If the release is `2.0.0-beta.2`, the tag should `release-2.0.0-beta.2`

> ![CAUTION]
> Pushing a matching tag to the upstream (apache) branch will trigger CI to publish the artifacts to crates.io and
> pypi.org, which, if successful, is irreversible. Same versions are not allowed to publish more than once.

Once the CI completes, check crates.io and pypi.org for the new release artifacts.

## ASF work

### Upload source release

Run the below script to create source release artifacts.

```shell
./release/create_src_release.sh
```

Upload source release artifacts to SVN (dev).

```shell
./release/upload_src_release_to_dev.sh
```

### Start a `[VOTE]` thread
